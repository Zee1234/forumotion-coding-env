		.my-details
			span.my-red.my-bold Appearance
			p.
				Jamie has orange-red hair and gray eyes. Her oval face hosts a pair of ears that shoot out to the sides.
				Frown lines line her upper lip from long hours grimacing to the sound of metal pounding upon metal.
				Standing six foot one inch high, her height was an annoyance until she stopped caring about
				what other people thought. It still sometimes gets to her, but she is comfortable enough. Her wide shoulders,
				boxy build, and years of hard labor have resulted in her being incredibly strongly built, though not quite buff.
			br
			span.my-red.my-bold Personality
			p.
				Jamie is a very "no nonsense" person. She takes pride in her work and enjoys what she does. She is a
				focused and rational thinker, but has a history of being too trusting, resulting in being taken advantage of.
				Despite this, she prefers to be loyal to friends and keep up with her responsibilities. She powers through
				challenges and is not afraid to stand in the face of danger.
			br
			span.my-red.my-bold History
			p.
				Long ago, Jamie was born in the magnificant city, the Village of Skyscrapers, Tengakure. She grew up
				leading the life of a civilian. Her father worked with the massive machines that built and maintained the city,
				even though he lacked the ability to run them. Following in her father's footsteps, she learned how to
				shape metal and build, or at least repair, the massive constructs.
